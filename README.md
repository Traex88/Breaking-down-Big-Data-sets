# Big Data Project - 
In this project I was tasked to put my ETL skills to use. Amazon has a rather large dataset of shoppers that would depend on reviewers in order to make a purchase. Since the data is made public and the files are quite large in nature, some of the data can exceed what a local machine can compute. Some datasets are quite large in a sence where there are  millions of rows and can be taxing to a local machine. My goal in this process to was to perform an ETL in the clould and up load a dataframe using an RDS instance while after using a combination of pyspark and SQL to perform a statistaical analysis of the data I had selected.



### Summary

I was tasked to find a large data set from of Amazon's customer review datasets and essentially break them down into smaller datasets that can easily be read. All of the data was extracted, transformed then loaded into smaller sets so.
